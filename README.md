# Data-Structures
Various data structures in Java

Basically I'm creating a data structues reference. I spent 
two years interviewing with Amazon, Microsoft, Bank of America, Attachemate,
Google, and a few other big companies from 2013 to 2014. In many cases, I made on-site interviews.

Most of the interview questions focused on trees with a couple of lists
and a few of brain teasers. I didn't do well on the tree problems and missed
one of the list problems. I plan to interview with some of these companies again.
Therefore, I've decided to create a data structure reference to prepare
for the interviews.

The reference includes the solutions to interview questions and "standard" data structure operations.
I'll update this README file as the reference grows.

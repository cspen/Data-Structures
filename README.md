# Data-Structures
Various data structures in Java

Basically I'm creating a data structues reference. I spent 
2013 and 2014 interviewing with Amozon, Microsoft, Bank of America, Attachemate,
Google, and a few other big companies. In many cases I made it to the on-site interview.

Most of the interview questions focused on trees with a couple about lists
and a few brain teasers. I didn't do well on the tree problems and missed
one of the list problems. I plan to interview with some of these companies again.
Therefore, I've decided to create a data structure refeence I can study to prepare
for the interviews.

I'm including the solutions to interview questions as well as "standard" data structure operations.
I'll update this README file as the reference grows.
